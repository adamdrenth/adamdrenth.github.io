    <h1>Homemade Maple Cinnamon Pop Tarts</h1>
    <h5>Braden Wilson</h5>
    <p>
    Anyone who's ever eaten Pop Tarts before should know that they're a delicious and godly treat (If you've never
    tried them I strongly recommend you try them). My only complaint about pop tarts is how fake, chemical-filled,
    and unhealthy they feel. My solution is this great recipe to make brown sugar cinnamon Pop Tarts (the best kind)
    completely homemade and from scratch.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Pastry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups (315g) of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons (90g) of unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (154g) of vegetable shortening, chilled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) of ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Note that the pastry part can be substituted for store bought pastry or your favorite pie crust recipe, but
        I find that this flaky and slightly crunchy pastry works perfectly with pop tarts.</em>
    </p>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) of packed dark or light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (8g) of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>egg wash:</strong> 1 large egg mixed with 2 teaspoons of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Get creative and try using some of your own fillings like jam, Nutella, etc.</em>
    </p>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup of confectioners' sugar (90g), sifted</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (15ml) of milk, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>For the pastry:</b> I usually make the pastry the night before. First, mix the flour and salt together
            in a large bowl. Add cold unsalted butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the butter
            and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal (pea-sized crumbles with a few larger bits of fat is
            OK). Measure 1/2 cup of water in a glass. Add ice. Stir it around. Slowly drizzle in the very cold water 1
            Tablespoon at a time, stirring with a large spatula after every Tablespoon of water that you add. Do not add
            any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to clump.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Roll out the dough on a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel
            overly sticky. Form the dough into a ball. Divide in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using
            your hands. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or up to 5 days or in the
            freezer for up to 3 months).
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Assemble the pop-tarts:</b> Remove 1 chilled dough disc from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room
            temperature for 15 minutes. This will help make the dough easier to roll and work with. Keep the other disc
            in the refrigerator. After 15 minutes, place disc onto a lightly floured work surface, and roll it into a
            rectangle about 1/8 inch thick and 9x12 inches in size. Trim the sides as needed. Always be gentle with your
            pastry dough. You don't want it to tear. Cut each piece of dough into thirds and each third into thirds
            again. You will end up with 9 rectangles, each measuring 3×4 inches. Use a ruler to help make this process
            easier and more accurate.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Place each of the 9 rectangles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. The
            pop-tarts will not spread in the oven much, so you may place them relatively near one another. Place the
            baking sheet in the fridge. Roll 2nd disc out into a rectangle and cut into 9 even rectangles like you did
            with the first half of the dough. These nine rectangles will be the tops of your homemade pop-tarts. Place
            the baking sheet into the refrigerator as you make the brown sugar cinnamon filling.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Make the filling:</b> Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour together in a small bowl. Set aside.
            Remove 1 baking sheet of rectangles from the refrigerator. Brush egg wash over the entire surface of teach
            rectangle. These will be the bottoms of your pop-tarts and the egg wash will help glue the lid on. Place a
            heaping Tablespoon of the prepared brown sugar filling into the center of each rectangle, spread it around,
            leaving around 1/4 inch of space on the edges. Brush the second baking sheet of rectangles with egg wash,
            then place each rectangle on top of the filling-topped rectangles - egg wash side down. Use your fingertips
            to press firmly around the pocket of filling, sealing the dough well on all sides.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Poke holes in the tops of each filled pastry to allow the steam to escape. This helps get your pop-tart
            pastry nice and flaky. I used a toothpick to poke 8 holes in each. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork,
            to prevent the sides from opening as the pop-tarts bake. Refrigerate the filled pop-tarts uncovered for at
            least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. This chilling let the pop-tarts rest before baking. It also firms up the
            pastry, since it has been out at room temperature for so long at this point.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Once unbaked pop-tarts have chilled for 20 minutes, remove from the
            refrigerator and brush the tops with the remaining egg wash. This egg wash will give your pastry that
            beautiful golden sheen. Bake for about 22-28 minutes or until they’re golden brown, rotating the pan halfway
            through baking. Let the baked pop-tarts cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to
            cool completely before glazing.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Make the glaze:</b> whisk all of the glaze ingredients together in a medium bowl until it reaches a
            spreading consistency. You want a thick glaze, but not too thick that it is hard to spread. Add another
            teaspoon or two of milk if needed. Use a spoon or knife to glaze each pop-tart. The glaze will slightly
            harden in about an hour, if you prefer to wait that long.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            Store pop-tarts in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 6 days.
            To reheat, bake in a 350F degree oven for 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Make ahead tip/freezing:</strong> Baked and unglazed pop-tarts freeze well, up to 3 months. Thaw and reheat as
        directed in step 9. I am unsure about reheating in a toaster.
