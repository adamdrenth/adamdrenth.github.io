   <h2 style="color: #449944">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
        <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: #1111FF">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth.
            Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), or until a
            tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan
            and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <em>
            The best bananas for banana bread are the over ripe ones that are half brown on the outside
            peel and fully soft and browning on the inside.
